This GitHub page of mine has been sitting idle for a couple of years now but today I decided to start giving it some life. I've been blogging on Postach.io for almost 2 years but recently Postach.io has removed the free-tier option, and at the same time increased the premium account fee so users have no choice but to opt for the premium or leave. Good thing I'm an early premium adopter so I get to enjoy lifetime discount but thinking about it again, Postach.io offers very little for the amount they are charging. I keep it because currently there's no better alternative to their convenient Evernote-blogging approach (there's Blogwith.co but haven't seen much improvement from the one-man developer since last year). The theming has recently added GitHub but not everybody is able to use it. I for example prefer the older WYSIWYG theme editor which is still being offered as an option but it's not as good as Google's Blogger (BlogSpot) built-in drag-drop theme editor, not to mention we can only replace the existing templates but not creating a new one (unless we use GitHub of course, but activating GitHub theming would disable the built-in them editer instead).

So I asked myself, if I left Postach.io would that mean going back to WordPress? WordPress, been there done that. Don't get me wrong, I like WordPress but customizing the already complex system is a pain. I could have hired somebody to customize it but I could not find someone near me who is capable of providing such survice (I don't know any coder, or a reliable one around me, or some have a degree in computer science but has since built a career in a different field and thus forgotten the programming knowledge in the process). So I was thinking why not go for something that is notable, free, not as complicated as WordPress and not awfully feature-less like Postach.io but settle in between and still allow customization should I need it. GitHub falls perfectly in that category so here I am, trying to familiarize myself with the innards and exploring its various functions/features.
